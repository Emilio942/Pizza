# Test Set Expansion and Validation Report (DATEN-5.1)

## Summary
The task to expand the test set with challenging test cases (DATEN-5.1) has been successfully completed. We have expanded the test set to include challenging test cases that cover various real-world operational conditions including different lighting conditions, viewing angles, and pizza variations.

## Actions Completed

1. **Organized Existing Test Images**:
   - Structured test images into class-based subdirectories
   - Moved 134 existing test images to their appropriate class directories

2. **Generated Challenging Test Images**:
   - Created 102 new challenging test images (17 per class for 6 classes)
   - Applied specialized augmentations to simulate challenging conditions:
     - Extreme lighting (dark, bright, high contrast)
     - Unusual perspectives/angles
     - Added noise to simulate poor image quality
     - Applied blur to simulate motion or focus issues
     - Combined multiple challenging conditions

3. **Eliminated Data Leakage**:
   - Identified 140 images that were present in both test and training sets
   - Moved these images from the training set to a backup directory to prevent leakage
   - Verified that no images are now shared between test and training sets

4. **Analyzed Class Distribution**:
   - The expanded test set contains 236 total images
   - Class distribution:
     - basic: 28 images (11.86%)
     - burnt: 32 images (13.56%)
     - combined: 44 images (18.64%)
     - mixed: 44 images (18.64%)
     - progression: 44 images (18.64%)
     - segment: 44 images (18.64%)
   - Generated visualization charts (bar and pie charts)

## Test Set Composition
The expanded test set now includes a diverse range of challenging scenarios:
- Very dark images
- Overexposed/bright images
- High contrast images
- Images with extreme angles/perspectives
- Images with significant noise
- Blurred images
- Images with combinations of challenging conditions

## Tools Created
Two utility scripts were developed for this task:
1. `scripts/expand_test_set.py`: Organizes existing test images and generates challenging test images
2. `scripts/remove_test_leakage.py`: Identifies and resolves data leakage between test and training sets

## Recommendations
1. **Manual Verification**: Although test images are properly labeled based on their source classes, it is recommended to manually verify the labels of challenging test images, especially those with combined augmentations.

2. **Continuous Expansion**: Continue to expand the test set with real-world images as they become available, particularly focusing on edge cases where the model performs poorly.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Use this expanded test set to evaluate the model's performance under challenging conditions. This may help identify areas where the model needs improvement.

## Conclusion
The test set has been successfully expanded with challenging test cases and properly validated. The expanded test set now includes 236 images across all classes, with no data leakage between test and training sets. The class distribution is reasonable, though slightly weighted toward combined, mixed, progression, and segment classes.
