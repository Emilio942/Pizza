# Pizza Dataset Balancing - Task DATEN-2.2

## Summary of Actions
This report documents the completion of task DATEN-2.2: Balancing the dataset to ensure better class distribution.

## Initial Analysis
The initial class distribution analysis showed significant imbalance:
- Largest class: combined (50 samples)
- Underrepresented classes:
  - basic: 32 samples (64% of largest class)
  - burnt: 28 samples (56% of largest class)

## Solution Approach
We initially attempted to use the existing `balance_dataset.py` script, but it wasn't generating enough augmented samples. Investigation revealed that there were only a few source images in the underrepresented class directories, which limited the augmentation process.

We created an enhanced balancing script (`balance_dataset_enhanced.py`) which:
1. Analyzes the current class distribution
2. Identifies underrepresented classes (those with less than 80% of the samples of the largest class)
3. Uses direct image augmentation techniques to generate additional diverse samples:
   - Rotation
   - Flipping (horizontal and vertical)
   - Brightness, contrast, and color adjustments
   - Blurring
   - Posterization and solarization
4. Applies multiple random augmentations to each source image
5. Saves the augmented images to the appropriate class directories
6. Re-analyzes the class distribution to verify the improvements

## Results
The enhanced balancing script successfully balanced the dataset:
- **basic**: Increased from 32 to 48 samples (92.31% of largest class)
- **burnt**: Increased from 28 to 52 samples (100% of largest class)
- All classes now exceed the 80% threshold relative to the largest class

The new class distribution shows a well-balanced dataset:
```
basic: 48 samples (92.31% of largest class)
burnt: 52 samples (100.00% of largest class)
combined: 50 samples (96.15% of largest class)
mixed: 50 samples (96.15% of largest class)
progression: 50 samples (96.15% of largest class)
segment: 50 samples (96.15% of largest class)
```

## Future Recommendations
1. **Increase Source Images**: For better diversity, consider adding more original images to underrepresented classes. This would improve augmentation quality.
2. **Advanced Augmentation**: Consider implementing more domain-specific augmentations for pizza images (texture changes, simulated baking effects).
3. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Regularly check class distribution as new data is added to ensure continued balance.

## Conclusion
The task DATEN-2.2 is now complete, with all classes containing at least 80% of the sample count of the largest class, ensuring a more balanced training dataset that will lead to improved model performance across all pizza classes.
