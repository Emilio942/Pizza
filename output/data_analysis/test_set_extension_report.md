# Test Set Extension Report

## Overview
This report documents the extension of the test set for the pizza classification project, adding challenging test cases to evaluate the model's performance under realistic operational conditions.

## Original Test Set Analysis
Before extension, the test set consisted of **236 images** distributed across the following classes:
- basic: 28 images (11.86%)
- burnt: 32 images (13.56%)
- combined: 44 images (18.64%)
- mixed: 44 images (18.64%)
- progression: 44 images (18.64%)
- segment: 44 images (18.64%)

## Test Set Extension Strategy
The test set extension focused on creating challenging test cases that mimic real-world conditions:

1. **Lighting Variations**:
   - Dark conditions
   - Bright/overexposed
   - Uneven lighting
   - Low contrast
   - Shadowed
   - Backlit

2. **Perspective Variations**:
   - Side angles
   - Top-down views
   - Close-up views
   - Diagonal angles

3. **Quality/Noise Variations**:
   - Added noise
   - Blurry images
   - JPEG compression artifacts
   - Motion blur

## Extended Test Set
After extension, the test set now consists of **428 images** distributed as follows:
- basic: 50 images (11.68%)
- burnt: 58 images (13.55%)
- combined: 80 images (18.69%)
- mixed: 80 images (18.69%)
- progression: 80 images (18.69%)
- segment: 80 images (18.69%)

In total, **192 new challenging test images** were added to the test set.

## Verification Process
1. **Data Leakage Prevention**: All generated test images were verified to ensure they are not duplicates of images in the training or validation sets.
2. **Class Distribution**: The class distribution was maintained similar to the original test set, ensuring balanced evaluation.
3. **Challenging Conditions**: Each test image includes at least one challenging condition (lighting, perspective, or quality) to test the model's robustness.

## Visual Analysis
Class distribution visualizations (bar chart and pie chart) are available in the `output/data_analysis` directory:
- `test_class_distribution.png`
- `test_class_distribution_pie.png`

## Next Steps
1. Evaluate the model's performance on the extended test set
2. Identify specific weaknesses based on performance on challenging subsets
3. Use insights to guide future model improvements
