### Sleep Mode Implementation
```python
# Enhanced sleep mode with performance tracking
def enter_sleep_mode(self) -> None:
    if not self.sleep_mode:
        sleep_transition_start = time.perf_counter()
        
        # Set sleep state
        self.sleep_mode = True
        self.sleep_start_time = time.time()
        
        # Save current state for restoration
        self.original_ram_used = self.ram_used
        self._save_peripheral_states()
        
        # Systematic peripheral shutdown
        self._shutdown_peripherals()
        
        # Enhanced RAM reduction (up to 80%)
        enhanced_sleep_reduction = min(0.8, self.sleep_ram_reduction + 0.2)
        self.ram_used = int(self.original_ram_used * (1 - enhanced_sleep_reduction))
        
        # Performance measurement
        sleep_transition_time = (time.perf_counter() - sleep_transition_start) * 1000

def wake_up(self) -> None:
    if self.sleep_mode:
        wake_transition_start = time.perf_counter()
        
        # Calculate sleep duration
        sleep_duration = time.time() - self.sleep_start_time
        self.total_sleep_time += sleep_duration
        
        # Fast RAM restoration
        self.ram_used = self.original_ram_used
        
        # Fast peripheral restoration
        self._restore_peripherals()
        
        # Update power manager
        self.power_manager.update_energy_consumption(sleep_duration, False)
        
        # Performance measurement
        wake_transition_time = (time.perf_counter() - wake_transition_start) * 1000
        self.wake_transition_times.append(wake_transition_time)
        
        # Clear sleep mode flag
