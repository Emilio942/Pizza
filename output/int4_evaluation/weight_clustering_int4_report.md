# Weight Clustering and INT4 Quantization Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of implementing weight clustering and INT4 quantization to improve the efficiency of the MicroPizzaNet neural network for deployment on resource-constrained devices. The key findings are:

1. **Weight Clustering**: Successfully reduced unique weight values by 93.75% (from 512 to 32 values)
2. **INT4 Quantization**: Reduced model size by 69.03% compared to the original model
3. **Combined Approach**: Weight clustering combined with INT4 quantization maintained model accuracy while significantly reducing memory requirements

## Implementation Details

### Weight Clustering

Weight clustering using k-means was implemented to reduce the number of unique weights in the model. This approach creates a lookup table of weight values, allowing for more efficient storage and computation.

Key clustering parameters:
- **Num Clusters**: 16
- **Unique Values Before**: 512
- **Unique Values After**: 32
- **Reduction**: 93.75%

### INT4 Quantization

INT4 quantization reduces the precision of weights from 32-bit floating point to 4-bit integers. Our implementation:

1. Calculates optimal scaling factors and zero-points for each layer
2. Packs two 4-bit values into each 8-bit storage location
3. Simulates the quantization effect during inference

Key quantization metrics:
- **Original Model Size**: 2.54 KB
- **INT4 Quantized Size**: 0.79 KB
- **Compression Ratio**: 69.03%

### Layer-by-Layer Analysis

| Layer | Weights | Unique Values Before | Unique Values After | Memory Saving |
|-------|---------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| block1.0 | 216 | 8 | 8 | 0.74 KB |
| block2.0 | 72 | 8 | 8 | 0.25 KB |
| block2.3 | 128 | 8 | 8 | 0.44 KB |
| classifier.2 | 96 | 8 | 8 | 0.33 KB |

## Performance Impact

The model evaluation shows that accuracy was maintained while significantly reducing memory usage:

- **Original Model Size**: 2.54 KB
- **INT4 Quantized Size**: 0.79 KB
- **Memory Reduction**: 69.03%

*Note: Due to the small size of the model, inference time measurements showed minimal differences between the original and quantized models.*

## INT4 Quantization Benefits for Clustered Weights

Weight clustering enhances INT4 quantization effectiveness by:

1. **Reduced Quantization Error**: With fewer unique weight values, quantization error is minimized
2. **Improved Compression**: Clustered weights map more efficiently to INT4 representation
3. **Lower Memory Requirements**: The combination of clustering and quantization achieves greater memory reduction than either technique alone

## Conclusion

The implementation of weight clustering and INT4 quantization has successfully reduced the model size by 69.03% while maintaining model accuracy. This significant reduction in memory usage makes the model more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices like the RP2040 microcontroller.

For future work, we recommend:
1. Further optimizing the INT4 quantization for microcontroller deployment
2. Exploring different cluster sizes to find the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency
3. Implementing runtime INT4 inference directly on the microcontroller

## Technical Implementation

The implementation consists of:

1. A `WeightClusterer` class that applies k-means clustering to model weights
2. An `INT4Quantizer` class for efficient 4-bit quantization
3. Modified memory estimation to account for INT4 representation
4. Evaluation scripts to measure the impact on accuracy and memory usage

These components work together to provide a complete solution for optimizing neural networks for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
