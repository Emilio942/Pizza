## Dataset Analysis Results

### Current State (DATEN-2.1 Findings)
```
Class Distribution Analysis:
- basic: 30 images (53.57%)
- burnt: 26 images (46.43%) 
- combined: 0 images (0.0%)
- mixed: 0 images (0.0%)
- progression: 0 images (0.0%)
- segment: 0 images (0.0%)

Total: 56 images across 6 classes
```

### Identified Issues
1. **Severe Class Imbalance**: Only 2/6 classes have substantial representation
2. **Missing Classes**: 4 classes have 0-17 images (critical underrepresentation)
3. **Insufficient Diversity**: Limited lighting conditions and cooking states

### Target Goals
```
Balanced Distribution Target:
- basic: 50 images (+20 to generate)
- burnt: 50 images (+24 to generate)
- combined: 50 images (+50 to generate)
- mixed: 50 images (+50 to generate)
- progression: 50 images (+50 to generate)
- segment: 50 images (+50 to generate)

Total Target: 300 images (244 new synthetic images)
```

## Generation Strategy Specifications

### Prompt Templates Defined

- **4 lighting conditions** (overhead_harsh, side_dramatic, dim_ambient, backlit_rim)
- **3 burn levels** for burnt class (slightly, moderately, severely burnt)
- **Professional food photography** standards maintained

### Distribution Strategy
- **Even lighting distribution**: 25% per lighting condition
- **Burn level distribution**: 40% slight, 35% moderate, 25% severe
- **Priority-based generation**: Critical classes first (0 images)
- **Quality verification**: All images must pass property verification (≥0.6 score)

### Technical Parameters
- **Model**: stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0
- **Resolution**: 512x512 pixels
- **Quality Control**: Property verification enabled
- **Memory Optimization**: CPU offloading and attention slicing
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 attempts per image with verification

## Implementation Plan Validation

### Automated Planning ✅
The automation script successfully generates a detailed execution plan:
- **32 generation tasks** organized by priority
- **232 total images** to be generated
- **Intelligent distribution** across lighting conditions and burn levels

### Generation Sequence
1. **Phase 1 - Critical Classes** (192 images): combined, mixed, progression, segment
2. **Phase 2 - High Priority** (24 images): burnt class with burn level variations  
3. **Phase 3 - Medium Priority** (20 images): basic class completion

### Quality Assurance
- **Property verification** for all generated images
- **Manual review** of 10% sample
- **Metadata tracking** for all generation parameters
- **Success rate monitoring** (target: ≥80%)

## Technical Infrastructure

### Pipeline Integration ✅
