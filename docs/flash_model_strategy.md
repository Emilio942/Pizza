# Feasibility Study: Flash Memory Optimization for Model Components

## 1. Objective

Investigate methods to optimize flash memory usage by compressing and dynamically loading select model components during runtime. The goal is to reduce the overall flash footprint of the model while minimizing the impact on RAM usage and inference speed.

## 2. Compression Techniques for Microcontrollers

### 2.1. Survey of Existing Libraries and Methods
This section will list and briefly describe compression libraries and techniques suitable for microcontroller environments. Key considerations include:
    - Low memory footprint for decompression routines.
    - In-place or minimal RAM overhead decompression.
    - Efficiency on typical microcontroller architectures (e.g., ARM Cortex-M).

Potential candidates:
    - **Heatshrink:** A compression library for embedded systems, designed for low memory use. Supports in-place decompression.
    - **LZ4:** Known for its very fast decompression speed. Implementations for microcontrollers exist.
    - **Run-Length Encoding (RLE):** Simple and effective for data with many repeated values. Low overhead.
    - **Huffman Coding:** Optimal prefix coding, can be effective but might require more complex decompression logic and tables.
    - **Custom/Simplified Schemes:** Tailored compression for specific model layer types (e.g., sparse layers).

### 2.2. Focus on In-Place Decompression
In-place decompression is critical to minimize RAM overhead. This means the compressed data is replaced by the decompressed data in the same memory region, or with a very small, fixed-size buffer.

### 2.3. Runtime Performance Implications
The decompression speed directly impacts inference time if components are loaded on-demand. Benchmarks for decompression speed vs. compression ratio will be important.

## 3. Identification of Candidate Model Components

### 3.1. Analysis of Layer Parameter Usage Patterns
Not all parts of a neural network model are used equally or at the same time.
    - **Infrequently Used Layers:** Later layers in a network or layers specific to certain classes in a multi-headed model might be candidates.
    - **Large Layers:** Layers with a large number of parameters (e.g., fully connected layers, large convolution filters) offer the most significant size reduction potential.

### 3.2. Mapping Memory Access Frequencies
    - **Initial Layers:** Typically accessed for every inference, making them less suitable for dynamic loading due to performance impact.
    - **Final Layers/Specific Paths:** May only be needed towards the end of an inference or for specific execution paths (e.g., in models with early exits).

### 3.3. Potential Components for Compression
Based on the above, potential candidates include:
    - Parameters of deeper convolutional layers.
    - Parameters of fully connected layers, especially if they are large.
    - Components of the model that are only used for specific, less frequent tasks.
    - Potentially, embedding tables or similar large, static data structures.

## 4. Technical Assessment

### 4.1. Quantify Expected RAM Savings
This will depend on the chosen components and the compression ratio achieved. The primary goal is flash savings, but RAM is needed for decompression.
    - If not in-place, RAM = size of decompressed component.
    - If in-place, RAM = minimal buffer for decompression + final space for the component.

### 4.2. Measure Decompression Overhead
This is the additional time taken to decompress the component during runtime.
    - **Impact on Inference Time:** `Total Inference Time = Original Inference Time + Decompression Time`. This needs to be acceptable.
    - Benchmarking on the target microcontroller (RP2040) is crucial.

### 4.3. Evaluate Implementation Complexity
    - Modifying the model loading mechanism.
    - Integrating the chosen decompression library.
    - Managing memory for compressed and decompressed data.
    - Ensuring data integrity.

### 4.4. Consider Impact on Model Inference Time
    - **Worst-case:** If a frequently used component is compressed and needs decompression at every inference.
    - **Best-case:** Infrequently used components are loaded only when needed, with minimal overall impact.

## 5. Implementation Strategy

### 5.1. Required Code Modifications
    - **Model Loader:** Update the TensorFlow Lite Micro (or custom) model loader to handle compressed weights. This might involve:
        - Identifying compressed tensors/layers (e.g., via metadata in the model file).
        - Allocating memory for decompression (if not fully in-place).
        - Calling the decompression routine.
    - **TensorFlow Lite Micro Interpreter:** Potentially modify how the interpreter accesses weights if they are not all present in RAM initially.

### 5.2. Memory Management Approach
    - **Static Allocation:** Allocate a fixed region in RAM where components are decompressed. This region could be reused.
    - **Dynamic Allocation (if feasible):** More complex on microcontrollers, risk of fragmentation.
    - **Memory Pools:** Pre-allocate pools for specific component sizes.
    - **Flash Layout:** How compressed components are stored in flash and located.

### 5.3. Loading/Unloading Triggers
    - **Load on Demand:** Decompress a component only when it's first accessed by the inference engine.
        - Requires checks before accessing weights.
    - **Pre-fetching:** Load components in the background if the execution flow is predictable.
    - **Unloading:** If RAM is extremely constrained, components might be unloaded (removed from RAM) after use, requiring decompression again on next access. This adds significant overhead. For this project, the focus is likely on load-on-demand without unloading during a single inference.

## 6. Evaluated Compression Methods with Benchmarks

Based on research and analysis of compression techniques suitable for microcontrollers, particularly the RP2040, the following methods have been evaluated:

| Method        | Library/Impl. | Compression Ratio (Est.) | Decompression Speed (Est. on RP2040) | RAM Overhead (Decomp) | Suitability |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Heatshrink    | heatshrink    | 1.5-2.0x                | ~400-600 KB/s                        | 50-100 bytes          | High        |
| LZ4           | lz4_embedded  | 1.3-1.8x                | ~1-2 MB/s                           | 8-12 KB               | Medium      |
| RLE           | custom        | 1.2-1.5x                | ~5-10 MB/s                          | <50 bytes             | High        |
| Huffman       | custom/tiny   | 1.4-1.8x                | ~300-500 KB/s                        | 512-1024 bytes        | Medium      |
| Delta+RLE     | custom        | 1.3-1.7x                | ~2-4 MB/s                           | <100 bytes            | High        |
| Weight Clustering | quantization | 2.0-4.0x              | None (direct loading)               | None                  | Very High   |

### Analysis of Methods:

#### Heatshrink
A dedicated compression library for embedded systems with excellent memory usage characteristics. It features dynamic memory requirements that can be as low as 50-100 bytes for the decoder, making it suitable for constrained environments. The compression ratio is generally good for the types of data found in neural network weights.

#### LZ4
Known for extremely fast decompression, which could be beneficial for dynamically loading components. However, the relatively high RAM requirements (8-12KB for the working buffer) make it less suitable for the RP2040's constrained environment when multiple operations may need RAM simultaneously.

#### Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
A simple and efficient compression technique particularly effective for neural network weights that often contain repeated values, especially after quantization and pruning. The minimal implementation overhead and extremely low decompression RAM requirements make it particularly suitable for our application.

#### Huffman Coding
Provides good compression ratios by encoding frequent values with fewer bits. The main drawback is the need to store and load the Huffman table, which increases RAM usage during decompression. Still, with a fixed Huffman table, the overhead can be reasonable.

#### Delta + RLE Encoding
A hybrid approach where we first apply delta encoding (storing differences between consecutive values rather than absolute values) and then apply RLE to the resulting data. This can be particularly effective for weight matrices with gradual changes in consecutive values.

#### Weight Clustering
Not a traditional compression method but a model optimization technique where similar weights are grouped and represented by a single value. This can achieve significant compression (e.g., replacing 4 bytes with 1 byte) while maintaining model accuracy. The benefit is that no decompression is needed as the weights are directly usable.

## 7. Implementation Effort Estimates

Based on the analysis of compression methods and the specific requirements of the RP2040 platform, we estimate the following implementation efforts:

- **Low Effort (1-3 days):**
  - Implementing basic RLE compression for model weights
  - Adding direct flash-to-RAM loading infrastructure for compressed components
  - Initial integration testing with a single layer

- **Medium Effort (4-7 days):**
  - Implementing Heatshrink or Delta+RLE compression with optimized decompression
  - Modifying the model loader to handle multiple compression schemes
  - Developing a memory management system for dynamic component loading
  - Comprehensive testing across all model components
  - Optimization of loading triggers based on usage patterns

- **High Effort (8+ days):**
  - Implementing a hybrid compression system with multiple algorithms
  - Advanced memory management with predictive loading
  - Custom hardware-accelerated decompression routines
  - Deep integration with CMSIS-NN for optimal performance
  - Development of sophisticated caching mechanisms

**Estimate for this project: Medium** - A carefully targeted implementation using Heatshrink or a custom RLE+Delta compression scheme for specific model components represents the best balance of gains versus implementation complexity.

## 8. Projected Memory Savings

Based on our analysis of the MicroPizzaNet architecture and compression techniques, we project the following memory savings:

### Current Model Profile:
- Total Model Size: ~0.63KB (8-bit quantized)
- RAM Usage During Inference: ~0.16KB for model parameters
- Additional Buffers:
  - buffer1-6: ~6.7KB total for intermediate results
  - col_buffer: ~0.3KB for CMSIS-NN operations
  - scratch_buffer: ~0.4KB for operations

### Compression and Flash Memory Optimization Strategy:

For the MicroPizzaNet specifically, we identify the following components as candidates for flash-based compression:

1. **Final Fully Connected Layer**:
   - Size: ~0.10KB (16 input features × 6 classes with 8-bit quantization)
   - Potential Compression: 1.5-2.0x with Heatshrink or RLE
   - Flash Savings: ~0.05KB
   - RAM Impact: Negligible temporary buffer (~50-100 bytes)

2. **Depthwise Convolution Weights**:
   - Size: ~0.22KB (8 channels, 3×3 kernel with 8-bit quantization)
   - Potential Compression: 1.3-1.8x with RLE or Delta+RLE
   - Flash Savings: ~0.07KB
   - RAM Impact: Negligible temporary buffer (~50-100 bytes)

### Projected Overall Savings:
- **Flash Savings**: ~0.12KB (~19% of model size)
- **RAM Impact**: Negligible increase during decompression (<0.1KB temporary buffer)
- **Performance Impact**: ~0.2-0.5ms additional latency per inference (estimated)

While the absolute savings for this specific model are modest due to its already efficient design, the approach demonstrates the feasibility of the technique. For larger models (e.g., future expansions with more parameters), the percentage savings would be similar but yield more significant absolute savings.

## 9. Technical Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                                     | Severity | Probability | Mitigation                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|----------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Increased inference time due to decompression | Medium | High | Focus on fast decompression algorithms (RLE); compress only infrequently used components; pre-load during idle periods. |
| RAM overflow during decompression        | High | Medium | Use in-place decompression with small temporary buffers; implement buffer size checks; simulate worst-case scenarios before deployment. |
| Decompression errors corrupting weights  | High | Low | Implement checksum verification for compressed data; extensive testing with diverse inputs; fallback mechanism to original weights if issues detected. |
| Integration complexity with CMSIS-NN     | Medium | Medium | Start with components not optimized by CMSIS-NN; develop clear interfaces between compressed storage and CMSIS functions; phase implementation gradually. |
| Performance regression on time-critical paths | High | Medium | Profile model execution to identify critical vs. non-critical components; keep critical-path components uncompressed; optimize decompression routines for speed. |
| Increased code complexity                | Medium | High | Create abstraction layers to hide compression details; thoroughly document compression scheme and implementation; implement unit tests for each component. |
| Flash wear due to frequent writing       | Low | Low | Not applicable for our use case (read-only model parameters); compression happens offline, not on-device. |

## 10. Recommendations with Justification

Based on our comprehensive analysis of compression techniques, model architecture, and implementation considerations, we make the following recommendations for flash memory optimization of neural network model components:

### Primary Recommendation:
**Implement a hybrid approach with Delta+RLE compression for the depthwise convolution weights and Heatshrink for the fully connected layer.**

#### Justification:
1. **Optimal Compression-to-Complexity Ratio**: This approach targets the components most suitable for compression while using algorithms appropriately matched to their data patterns:
   - Depthwise convolution weights often have gradual value changes, making Delta+RLE particularly effective.
   - Fully connected layer weights tend to have more complex patterns, where Heatshrink can achieve better compression.

2. **Minimal RAM Overhead**: Both techniques require very small temporary buffers (<100 bytes), which is crucial for the RP2040's constrained environment.

3. **Acceptable Performance Impact**: Both algorithms provide decompression speeds sufficient for these small components, adding minimal latency to the inference process.

4. **Manageable Implementation Complexity**: A targeted approach focusing on specific components reduces integration complexity compared to a system-wide approach.

### Secondary Recommendations:

1. **Implement Progressive Deployment**:
   - Start with only the fully connected layer for a proof of concept.
   - Expand to depthwise convolution weights after verification.
   - Consider additional components based on performance results.

2. **Consider Additional Optimizations**:
   - Explore weight clustering as a pre-compression step to achieve greater compression ratios.
   - Use a shared decompression buffer to minimize RAM overhead.
   - Implement a simple profiler to confirm actual component usage patterns.

3. **Future-Proof the Implementation**:
   - Design interfaces that can accommodate different compression schemes.
   - Establish metrics for evaluating compression effectiveness (size, speed, RAM usage).
   - Consider making compression type and ratio configurable to allow optimization for different deployment scenarios.

### Success Metrics:
The implementation should be considered successful if:
- Flash memory usage is reduced by ≥15% with no RAM increase exceeding 100 bytes.
- Inference speed degradation is limited to ≤5% compared to the baseline.
- Code complexity increase is moderate and well-documented.

While the absolute savings for the current MicroPizzaNet model are relatively modest due to its already optimized size, this approach establishes a pattern that can scale to larger models, potentially yielding more significant absolute savings in future iterations.

## 11. Sample Code or Proof-of-Concept

Below is a sample implementation demonstrating the proposed approach for compressing and loading model components from flash memory. This sample focuses on the fully connected layer using Heatshrink compression.

                         size_t compressed_size, size_t decompressed_size) {
    if (!compressed || !decompressed) return false;
    
    size_t in_pos = 0;
    size_t out_pos = 0;
    uint8_t last_value = 0; // For delta encoding
    
    while (in_pos < compressed_size && out_pos < decompressed_size) {

        }
    }
    
    return (out_pos == decompressed_size);
}
```

This proof of concept demonstrates the key components required for implementing flash-based compression for model weights:
1. Storage of compressed weights in flash memory
2. On-demand decompression into RAM
3. Integration with the existing model execution flow
4. Implementation of a custom compression scheme

A full implementation would include additional error handling, memory management, and integration with the model loader system.

## 13. Conclusion

This feasibility study demonstrates that flash memory optimization for neural network model components is a viable approach for the RP2040 microcontroller running the MicroPizzaNet model. While the absolute memory savings for this particular model are modest due to its already optimized size (~0.63KB), the techniques and approaches outlined here establish a foundation that can be scaled to larger models or future expansions.

The recommended hybrid approach using Delta+RLE compression for the depthwise convolution weights and Heatshrink for the fully connected layer offers the best balance of compression efficiency, implementation complexity, and runtime performance. The expected flash memory savings of ~19% come with minimal RAM overhead and acceptable performance impact.

The implementation effort is estimated at 4-7 days (medium complexity), with a clear path for progressive deployment starting with a proof of concept focused on the fully connected layer. The sample code provided demonstrates the key components of the implementation and can serve as a starting point for the development team.

By adopting this approach, the pizza detection system can maintain its current functionality while potentially accommodating future model enhancements without exceeding the RP2040's memory constraints.
