Please implement a precise simulation of the camera frame buffer in RAM to resolve the EMU-01 Framebuilder issue by:

1. Creating an accurate memory representation of the camera's frame buffer that:
   - Matches the exact dimensions and color depth of the target device
   - Implements proper byte alignment and padding
   - Handles all supported pixel formats correctly

2. Ensuring proper synchronization between:
   - Frame buffer write operations
   - Memory access patterns
   - Frame timing signals

3. Validating that:
   - Memory boundaries are respected
   - Buffer overflows are prevented 
   - Frame data integrity is maintained
   - Performance meets real-time requirements

4. Adding logging and debugging capabilities to:
   - Monitor memory access patterns
   - Track frame buffer states
   - Detect potential timing issues
   - Validate frame data consistency

Technical constraints:
- Must match hardware specifications exactly
- Zero tolerance for memory leaks or buffer overflows
- Must maintain consistent frame rates
- Real-time performance requirements must be met

Note: Please refer to the EMU-01 hardware documentation for exact timing and memory specifications.
