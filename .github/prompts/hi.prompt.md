Build and optimize a CI/CD pipeline to automate script execution with the following requirements:

1. Integrate and validate multiple existing scripts including:
   - C&N optimization scripts
   - Additional utility scripts (to be specified)

2. Pipeline Requirements:
   - Verify script functionality through automated testing
   - Identify and document non-functioning scripts
   - Ensure proper script execution order and dependencies
   - Implement error handling and logging
   - Enable autonomous operation with minimal manual intervention

3. Technical Specifications:
   - Use terminal access for script execution and testing
   - Maintain detailed execution logs
   - Generate status reports for failed scripts
   - Document pipeline architecture and workflow
   - Implement retry mechanisms for intermittent failures

4. Deliverables:
   - Functional CI/CD pipeline configuration
   - Test results for all integrated scripts
   - Documentation of pipeline architecture
   - List of validated and failed scripts
   - Recommendations for script optimization

Please provide:
- Complete list of scripts to be integrated
- Any specific execution requirements
- Environment details and access credentials
- Success criteria for script validation
