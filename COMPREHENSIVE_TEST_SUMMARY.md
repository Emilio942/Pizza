## üéØ Production Readiness Assessment

### ‚úÖ Ready for Deployment
- **Core Functionality**: Pizza classification system fully operational
- **API Interface**: Complete RESTful API with health checks
- **Model Integration**: Both spatial and standard models working
- **Performance**: Acceptable inference times and throughput

### ‚ö†Ô∏è  Infrastructure Needs
- **Monitoring Setup**: Need Prometheus + Grafana deployment
- **Load Balancing**: Need Nginx configuration
- **Containerization**: Need Docker build optimization
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Need automated testing and deployment

### üîÆ Scaling Considerations
- **Memory**: Current 11.6GB GPU limits batch sizes to ~8 images
